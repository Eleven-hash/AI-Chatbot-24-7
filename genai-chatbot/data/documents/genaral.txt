Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. AI systems can perform tasks such as problem-solving, pattern recognition, decision-making, and natural language understanding.

There are two main types of AI:
1. Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task such as image recognition or language translation.
2. General AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. General AI is still a research goal and does not yet exist.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed. Machine learning models identify patterns in data and improve performance over time through experience.

There are three major types of machine learning:
1. Supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled data.
2. Unsupervised learning, where models discover patterns in unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement learning, where agents learn through rewards and penalties based on their actions.

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain and are particularly effective for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Generative AI is a class of artificial intelligence models that can generate new content such as text, images, audio, video, and code. Unlike traditional AI systems that only analyze data, generative AI systems create original outputs based on learned patterns.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of Generative AI trained on massive amounts of text data. LLMs can understand context, answer questions, summarize documents, translate languages, and generate human-like text responses. Examples include models used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and coding tools.

A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. Chatbots can be rule-based or AI-powered. AI-powered chatbots use machine learning and natural language processing to understand user intent and generate responses dynamically.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI architecture that combines information retrieval with text generation. In a RAG system, relevant documents are retrieved from a knowledge base and provided as context to a language model before generating a response. This approach reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy.

Vector databases are used in RAG systems to store numerical representations (embeddings) of text data. These embeddings allow semantic search, meaning the system can find relevant information even if the exact keywords are not present in the query.

Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Similar pieces of text have embeddings that are close to each other in vector space. Embeddings are generated using specialized models and are essential for similarity search.

LangChain is a framework designed to help developers build applications using large language models. It provides tools for prompt management, memory, document loading, retrieval, and chaining multiple components together in a structured way.

Conversation memory allows chatbots to remember recent interactions, enabling multi-turn conversations. Memory improves user experience by maintaining context across multiple messages rather than treating each query independently.

API-based chatbots expose endpoints that allow external systems to interact with the chatbot. This enables integration with web applications, messaging platforms, and enterprise systems while ensuring scalability and reliability.

Modern AI chatbots are used in various domains including customer support, education, healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. They help reduce operational costs, improve response times, and provide consistent user experiences.

Ethical considerations in AI include fairness, transparency, privacy, and security. Responsible AI systems should avoid biased outputs, protect user data, and provide clear limitations when information is unavailable.

AI systems should clearly communicate uncertainty. If a chatbot does not have enough information to answer a question accurately, it should state that limitation instead of generating incorrect or misleading responses.
